## Introduction
Online payment fraud is a significant issue that affects both businesses and consumers. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions and mitigate the risks associated with online payment fraud.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains transaction data, including various features that indicate the nature of the transaction. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-payment-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd online-payment-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training
The project explores various machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

The models are trained using a split of the dataset into training and testing sets. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model performance.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Results
The results of the models are compared, and the best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics. Detailed analysis and visualizations are provided in the notebook.

## Contributing
